4 vertices of polyhedron
0 extreme rays of recession cone
4 support hyperplanes of polyhedron (homogenized)

embedding dimension = 4
affine dimension of the polyhedron = 3 (maximal)
rank of recession monoid = 0 (polyhedron is polytope)
internal index = 10

size of triangulation   = 1
resulting sum of |det|s = 10

dehomogenization:
0 0 0 1
