(** A pointer to a cone.

    A homogeneous cone is just a cone; it is {x: Ax >= 0} for some A.

    An inhomogeneous cone is a homogeneous cone intersected with the constraint
    x0 = 1, so an inhomogeneous cone defines a polyhedron.
    Constraints of the inhomogeneous cone such as inequalities and equalities
    are the constraints of this polyhedron, by reading the x0 component as 1.
    Generators of the inhomogeneous cone such as extreme rays, lineality space
    generators, and vertices are the generators of this polyhedron by firstly,
    normalizing each vector to get 1 in the x0 component (possibly getting
    fractional entries as a result), and secondly, by dropping the x0 component.

    Note that the constraint x0 = 1 cannot be explicitly expressed because a
    homogeneous cone only allows linear forms and not affine forms,
    and hence does not show up among the equations of an inhomogeneous cone.
    (This is also why we cannot define a polyhedron ourselves by just adding
    this constraint to a cone.)

    A cone_ptr points to either a homogeneous cone or an inhomogeneous one.

    Mathematically, the output cone is the input cone intersected
    with these equations. However, Normaliz can be sneaky and add a positive
    orthant constraint if the cone only has these equations, and this is one
    of other behaviors yet to be figured out. Hence, it is best to avoid these;
    add equations as two inequalities using [add_inequalities] instead.
